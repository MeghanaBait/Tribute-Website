        <h1>Cricket Journey</h1>
        <p>In 1984, Sachin’s older brother, Ajit, saw his ability and encouraged him to play cricket. Sachin was taken to Ramakant Achrekar’s training centre at Shivaji Park, Dadar, Bombay, by his father. He was smitten with Sachin and recommended that he join Sharadashram Vidyamandir English Jr High in Dadar. Sachin enrolled at his aunt’s residence, which was nearer to the Dadar school. Ramakant Achrekar’s effort and mentoring shaped his career. </p>
        <p>On December 11, 1988, Sachin scored 100 not out during a professional cricket match between Mumbai and Gujarat. He went on to play additional international and national cricket matches after that.</p>
        <p>He became the tournament’s leading run-scorer with 482 runs at an avg of 53.55 inside the 2011 World Cup win, and he couldn’t stop crying afterward. On December 5, 2012, Tendulkar was the first batter in history to reach 34,000 runs throughout all formats of cricket. </p>
        <p>He appeared in around 657 international cricket matches. His long-awaited 100th century came against Bangladesh inside the Asia Cup on March 16, 2012. Sachin declared his retirement from ODI cricket on December 23, 2012. He has also declared that he will not participate in T20 Internationals. He played for the following major cricket teams: Indian Cricket Teams, A.C.C. Asian XI, Mumbai Cricket, Mumbai Indians, and Yorkshire Cricket teams.</p>
        <p>Tendulkar became the first batsman in history to cross the 34,000 run aggregate in all formats of Cricket on 5 December 2012. In international cricket approx. he played a total of 657 matches. On 16th March 2012, his much-awaited 100th-century milestone was achieved against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup. Sachin announced his retirement on 23rd December 2012 from ODI Cricket. He also stated that he will not be playing in T20 Internationals.</p>
        
        <h2>Style of playing</h2>
        <p>Sachin Tendulkar is a versatile player who excels at both bowling and batting. He is left-handed, although he prefers to play with his right hand.</p>
        <p>Tendulkar is a right-handed batter who also bowls off-spin, legged spin, and medium speed. Many new and unconventional strokes, like the paddle sweep and other types of scoop and slash, have been included in his batting approach. He has also led several teams in various formats, such as the Indian national squad.</p>

        <h2>Captaincy</h2>
        <p>Tendulkar also was made captain of the Indian team, a position he held for two spells, neither of which was very successful. He took up the post in 1996, and the team’s performance over the next year and a half was extremely poor. He played Azharuddin as captain once more, but to little avail. Things eventually improved after Sourav Ganguly was appointed captain of the Indian side in 2000. It is claimed that captaincy added an unnecessary strain to Tendulkar’s career as a player and captain. Later, he captained the I.P.L. franchise Mumbai Indians and other exhibition teams.</p>

        <h2>Retirement</h2>
        <p>His remarkable 24-year cricket career ended on November 16, 2013, as he announced his retirement. He last appeared in an ODI in December 2012 and a T20 match in 2013. Let us remind readers that his final test match as a player was against the West Indies on November 16, 2013. Sachin Tendulkar is unquestionably one of the greatest hitters of all time. His music collection is almost limitless. At 16, he became the youngest player, and he subsequently broke and set new records. He has affected millions of people. He has a place in almost everyone’s heart all around the world. The first word that comes to mind and is on our tongue when we talk about cricket is Sachin.</p>
        <p>Sachin Tendulkar, widely thought to be the greatest cricketer of any time, is a modest but gifted, honest, and committed individual. There is much to be learned from him, both as a person and as a cricketer.</p>
